Simple Palindrome Checker in JavaScript
---------------------------------------
With Jade HMTL, we will use several methods;
The toLowerCase() method to return the calling string value converted to lowercase.
The replace() method to return a new string with some or all matches of a pattern replaced by a replacement. We will use one of the RegExp we just created earlier.
The split() method splits a String object into an array of strings by separating the string into sub strings.
The reverse() method reverses an array in place. The first array element becomes the last and the last becomes the first.
The join() method joins all elements of an array into a string.
